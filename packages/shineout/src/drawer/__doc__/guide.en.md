## Recommended/Cautionary Examples

### 1. It is suggested that the maximum width of the drawer should not exceed 80% of the screen width, as the initial intent of the drawer is to provide a quick access channel, not to replace the entire page.

### 2. Avoid designing too many nested levels, typically no more than two layers. Excessive levels can cause users to spend more time finding the information they need, increasing user burden and affecting the user experience.
