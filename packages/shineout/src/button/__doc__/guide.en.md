## When to Use

### Use when an operation command requires user interaction to trigger the corresponding business logic.

## Related to Layout

### 1. In pages, forms, dialogs, and other scenarios, buttons are generally placed along the user's browsing path for easy discovery, efficiently guiding actions.

### 2. Primary buttons are usually used on their own as the main visual focus of the page. It is recommended to have no more than one primary button on a page.

### 3. When a limited space necessitates more buttons than it can accommodate, secondary buttons may be collapsed or buttons can be grouped. The grouping can be based on primary/secondary roles or business scenarios.

## Component Combination

### Different types of buttons used together can express different levels of emphasis.

## Recommended/Cautionary Examples

### 1. When using primary and secondary buttons, it is necessary to express their hierarchy. Use primary buttons for emphasized actions and secondary buttons for other operations. It is forbidden to use multiple primary buttons at the same time.

### 2. When multiple buttons are used in combination, there should be a certain space between each button. It is not recommended to attach them directly together.

### 3. When multiple buttons are used in combination, and there is a need to wrap to a new line, they should be combined with layout components to prevent white space on the left side of the wrapping.
