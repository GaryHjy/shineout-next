## Combination with Other Components

### In practical applications, radio buttons are laid out with other components, following four types of alignments: left align, right align, horizontal center, and vertical center. Note that it is recommended to use only one alignment method within a business system for uniformity.

## Recommended/Cautionary Examples

### 1. In a form, do not use a radio button to turn a feature on; instead, use a checkbox or a toggle switch to turn a feature on or off. If there is only one option to choose from, consider using a checkbox as well.
