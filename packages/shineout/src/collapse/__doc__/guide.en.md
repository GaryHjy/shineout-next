## When to Use

### To group and categorize content, keeping the page clean\n To hide secondary or content that does not require complete reading, shortening the page length, improving screen efficiency, and reducing user scrolling

## Common Usage

### The collapsing panel remains sticky at the top when expanded; this is helpful when the content is extensive, as it allows users to constantly be aware of the content's main topic or type.

## Combination of Components

### Used in conjunction with forms, allowing for the addition or editing of information within the expanded panel. This provides a flat and immersive editing state for the user, avoiding task interruption that comes with pop-up layers or entering a secondary interface.

## Recommended/Cautionary Examples

### Avoid using too much information in the title; it is advised to distill key information. If there is more detailed content, it can be displayed in the folding area to help users differentiate between primary and secondary information hierarchy.
