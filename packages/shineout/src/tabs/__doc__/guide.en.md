## When to Use

### Tabs can be used to categorize content when there is a large amount of information on a page. This can improve the efficiency of finding information and also streamline the amount of information users receive at one time, helping them to focus more on the content currently displayed.

## Related to Layout

### When encountering multi-level page layouts, different styles and orientations of tabs can be combined to make the page hierarchy clearer.

![{maxWidth:100%}](001)
![{maxWidth:100%}](002)

## Recommended/Cautionary Examples

### 1. It's recommended to give tabs sufficient width and height according to the business context, to avoid truncating tab labels due to a width that is too narrow or creating tabs with click areas that are too small.

### 2. When there are too many tabs to fit on one line, they should not wrap onto new lines, nor should the text within the tabs. Instead, consider using a scrollable tab list.
