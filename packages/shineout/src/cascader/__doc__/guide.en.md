## When to Use

### Common scenarios include: 1. Data with a clear and consistent hierarchical structure, where cascading selections can support users in viewing data level by level; 2. Large data sets.

## Recommended/Cautious Examples

### 1. It is recommended that cascading selections do not exceed 4 levels. If the data structure genuinely requires more levels, it is advisable to use other more suitable forms of interaction or presentation methods for the data structure.

### 2. Avoid having too many levels as much as possible. In special cases, allow text to wrap within the container width, instead of causing a horizontal scrollbar to appear.
