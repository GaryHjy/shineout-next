## Related to Layout

### The positioning of the bubble confirmation box can be laid out according to the specific needs of the current page. The position should avoid covering page information or being obscured.

![Illustration: The maximum size for the popover is 300*300px, use a dialog box when content exceeds this width](003)

## Recommended Usage

### Both Popover bubbles and Tooltip hints have the function to display additional information. Since popovers can carry titles, paragraph texts, links, buttons, etc., they are the recommended component if operations on the additional information elements are required.
