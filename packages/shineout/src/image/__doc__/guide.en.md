## When to Use

### Use when images need to be displayed, showcased, or previewed; it also provides default placeholder styles for image loading, load failure, and when there are no images available.

## Related to Layout

### When displaying multiple images together, ensure that the images have uniform sizes and proportions to maintain consistency on the page. If there are exceptional circumstances, it is recommended that the images have a consistent width and uniform margins on all sides.

## Combination with Other Components

### 1. Combine images with pagination when there are too many images and a specific number needs to be displayed per page, allowing users to choose the page number to find images.

### 2. Combine images with step loading to create an image waterfall stream. When browsing a large number of images, this can reduce user interactions and provide an immersive experience.

## Recommended Image Ratios

### Four common aspect ratios are recommended. The system should use a consistent image ratio to avoid mixing different ratios in the same scenario.

## Recommended/Cautionary Examples

### For thumbnail images without a preview function, do not present them in too small a size, ensuring that users can clearly see the images.
