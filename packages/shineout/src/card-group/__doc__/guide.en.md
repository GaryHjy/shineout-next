## When to Use

### Use when needing to display different types of data as a collection in the same area\n when additional data or actions are required to supplement an explanation for an image\n when interactive content needs to vary in length within a spatial layout

## Combination of Components

### 1. Cards can be used with pagination when there are many cards and a set number needs to be displayed per page, allowing users to flip through pages to find images.

### 2. Cards can be used with step loading when there are many cards that need to be updated in real-time, or when a waterfall layout is needed, reducing user operations and providing an immersive experience.

### 3. Cards can be used with search boxes when there are many cards, allowing users to precisely search and quickly find the corresponding card.

## Recommended/Cautionary Examples

### When the data format is consistent and the information type is simple, it is recommended to use a list instead of cards to avoid increasing the complexity of the page.
