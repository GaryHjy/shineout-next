## When to Use

### To aggregate information of the same category, facilitating quick browsing and searching.

## Combination with Components

### 1. List combined with loading mechanism

![{maxWidth:100%}](001)

### 2. List combined with pagination, allowing users to navigate pages to find data when there is a surplus of information and a set number needs to be displayed per page.

![{maxWidth:100%}](002)

## Recommended/Cautionary Examples

### 1. It is recommended to keep the number of actions within a list to 3 or fewer. Use a dropdown menu to accommodate excess actions rather than presenting too many directly.

![{maxWidth:100%}success](003)
![{maxWidth:100%}warning](004)

### 2. When a list contains various types of content which require complex backend categorization, filtration, and management, it is recommended to use a table instead of a list.

![{maxWidth:100%}success](005)
![{maxWidth:100%}warning](006)
