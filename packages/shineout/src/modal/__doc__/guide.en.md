## When to Use

### When you need to display operation feedback or information alerts;\n When you need to fill in or display relevant information, requiring user interactions to be interrupted without disrupting the current flow

## Recommended/Cautionary Examples

### 1. The main explanatory text of a dialog should clearly express its purpose and the consequences of the operation.

![{maxWidth:100%}success](001)
![{maxWidth:100%}warning](002)

### 2. The buttons on the dialog should use action words that guide likely outcomes, rather than ambiguous terms.

![{maxWidth:100%}success](003)
![{maxWidth:100%}warning](004)

### 3. It is suggested to have no more than two pop-ups at a time.

![{maxWidth:100%}success](005)
![{maxWidth:100%}warning](006)

### 4. The width and height of the dialog box can be customized, but when content exceeds the maximum area and a scroll bar appears, it is recommended to keep the title and buttons fixed in place.

![{maxWidth:100%}success](007)
