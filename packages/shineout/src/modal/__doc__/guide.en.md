## When to use

When you need to display operation feedback or prompt information; when you need to fill in or display related information, interrupt user operations, but not interrupt the current process.

## Recommended/Cautious examples

![1. The main explanatory text of the dialog box needs to clearly express its purpose and the consequences of the operation](01)

![2. The buttons of the dialog box should use operation words that can guide the consequences, not ambiguous words](02)

![3. It is recommended that the number of pop-up windows does not exceed 2](03)

![4. The width and height of the dialog box can be customized, but when the content exceeds the maximum area and a scrollbar appears, it is recommended that the title and buttons remain fixed](03)
