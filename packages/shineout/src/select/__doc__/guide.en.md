## Multiple Columns of Options

### When there are many options available, it is advisable to use a multi-column layout, as it can display more options within the visible area.

## Maximum Size

### The maximum height is 7 rows; if the content exceeds this height, a vertical scrollbar should be shown. It's not recommended to have a horizontal scrollbar when there are too many options; instead, consider reducing the number of columns.

### 3. When there are many selected options, it is advised to consolidate selections or increase the width of the selector to avoid wrapping lines.

### 4. For easier reading, it is recommended that each column is of equal width, and options should not be truncated or wrapped. Consider reducing the number of columns or increasing the container width to fully display content.
