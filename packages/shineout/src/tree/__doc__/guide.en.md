## When to Use

### When there is a need to precisely and specifically mark the properties and dimensions of items;\n To facilitate user categorization, location finding, and system recognition.

## Related to Layout

### Try to avoid displaying too many tags on a page at once. In special cases, it's advised to show a maximum of 3-5 tags of higher priority and collapse the rest, with the option to hover to view more.

### When combining tags with images, be careful not to overlay too many tags to prevent obscuring the image.

### 3. Tags of the same type and visual weight should be as consistent as possible. Avoid using too many tag colors, and tags with the same color should be placed close together.

### 4. When multiple tags are used together, they should be combined with "layout components" to prevent white space on the left side when wrapping, causing misalignment with the first line.
