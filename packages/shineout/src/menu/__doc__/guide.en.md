## When to use

Used to carry the structure of the website and provide a menu list for navigation

## Related to layout

![Top navigation menu: Appears as the primary navigation of the page, common in information display websites;\nSide navigation menu: Can be used in conjunction with the top navigation menu as a secondary menu, or can be used as a primary menu alone](01)

## Component size

![The width of the side navigation can be defined according to the length of the text labels in actual business. Common ones are 200PX, 220PX, 240PX, 260PX]()

## Usage principles

![Keep the menu flat: A flat hierarchy can expose more functions to the user at the first time, thereby improving the efficiency of information reach and reducing operation steps;\nControl the number of menu items: According to Miller's Law, users can remember an average of 5-9 items. And when there are too many items, it will increase the user's selection time, and too many menu items will make users feel that the system content is complex and generate fear]()

## Copywriting guidelines

![Text labels need to clearly summarize the content of the module, and should use concise nouns, such as: "Home", "Discover", "Wallet", etc.]()

## Recommended/Cautionary examples

![The navigation menu is suitable for system-level function navigation, and should not be used for content and function organization of sub-modules. Information navigation of sub-modules should use the tab component](02)
